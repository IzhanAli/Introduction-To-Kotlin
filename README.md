# Introduction-To-Kotlin

## 1.  Output your name and age
We have to print our name and age using Kotlin In-Built Function.

## 2.	Take the same inputs from your user
Use readLine() method or Scanner class to take inputs from the user.

## 3.	Display all the taken info with additional string
Make use of print formatting to output all the details.

## 4.	Use the input for age taken by user and check if user is greater than 18 -> print valid
Given the input, use conditional statements to check the eligibility.

## 5.	Take inputs for two users and store the details of the older one
Use if-else as an expression here and make use of another variable to store the older age.

## 6.	Do the same with a when expression
Can we do the same but with using a when expression?

## 7.	Create a list of your friendâ€™s names and print the first two names
Make use of arrays here and try to understand the indexing of arrays to print the first two elements

## 8.	Print all the names in the list
Use a for loop in this case and make use of range method.

## 9.	Function to add two numbers
Let's use the concept of Functions and arguments.

## 10.	Function to check which one is older -> If-else condition

## 11. Lets study classes and objects a little
